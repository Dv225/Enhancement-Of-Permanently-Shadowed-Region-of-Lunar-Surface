    <h2>Idea of our model :</h2>
    <p>
        - OHRC and IIRS images are collected and preprocessed . Necessary transformations are applied on the data .​<br>
        - A shared Encoder architecture is used to extract common low-level features of both the images, which then get branched into dual outputs for <br>SE(Structural Embeddings) and RE(Resolution Embeddings).​<br>
        - Attention mechanism is used to focus on relevant regions of the images during encoding and decoding.<br>
        - CGAN architecture is used to generate enhanced images using both datasets.​<br>
        - Perceptual and standard embedding losses are incorporated to improve the quality of generated images.​<br>
        - Model is trained iteratively until an enhanced image is generated by updating the generator and discriminator using a combination of embedding losses,<br> perceptual loss, and conditional data.<br>
        - Model testing is done for the target image of  the PSR of the moon.​<br>
        - Output is further denoised and enhanced using CLAHE algorithm.​<br>
